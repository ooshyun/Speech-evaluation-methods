# Package Installation Setup - Changes Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to convert the Speech Evaluation Methods project into an installable Python package.

## Files Created

### 1. `setup.py`
- Classic Python package setup file
- Defines package metadata, dependencies, and installation configuration
- Enables installation with `pip install -e .`

### 2. `pyproject.toml`
- Modern Python packaging configuration (PEP 517/518)
- Contains build system requirements and project metadata
- Defines dependencies and optional dev dependencies
- Includes configuration for tools like Black

### 3. `MANIFEST.in`
- Specifies which non-Python files to include in the package distribution
- Includes README, LICENSE, and documentation files

### 4. `INSTALL.md`
- Comprehensive installation guide
- Multiple installation methods
- Troubleshooting section for common issues
- Dependency information

### 5. `verify_install.py`
- Verification script to check if installation was successful
- Tests imports and dependency availability
- Provides helpful feedback on missing components

### 6. `CHANGES.md` (this file)
- Summary of all changes made to the project

## Files Modified

### 1. `requirements.txt`
- Converted from conda format (platform-specific with build numbers) to standard pip format
- Uses version constraints (>=) for better compatibility
- Removed platform-specific build numbers
- Organized by category with comments

### 2. `src/__init__.py`
- Added import for `estimate_mrsstftloss` from auraloss module
- Added `__all__` list for explicit API definition
- Organized exports by category (STOI, SNR, SDR, PESQ, Composite, Auraloss)

### 3. `src/auraloss/_auraloss.py`
- Renamed function from `estimate_auraloss` to `estimate_mrsstftloss` to match imports
- Maintained all functionality

### 4. `README.md`
- Added Installation section at the top
- Added Quick Install instructions
- Added link to detailed INSTALL.md
- Added verification instructions

## How to Use the New Package Structure

### For Users

Install the package:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

Verify installation:
```bash
python verify_install.py
```

Use the package:
```python
from src import estimate_stoi, estimate_pesq, estimate_snr
```

### For Developers

Install with dev dependencies:
```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

This includes:
- black (code formatting)
- pytest (testing)

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Easy Installation**: Users can install with a single command
2. **Dependency Management**: All dependencies are automatically installed
3. **Development Mode**: Changes to source code are immediately reflected
4. **Standard Structure**: Follows Python packaging best practices
5. **Better Distribution**: Package can be uploaded to PyPI if desired
6. **Version Control**: Clear version tracking with semantic versioning

## Migration Notes

### Old Way (Before Changes)
```bash
# Had to manually install from conda requirements or requirements.txt
conda env create -f freeze.yml
# or
pip install -r requirements.txt  # (old conda format)
```

### New Way (After Changes)
```bash
# One command installs everything
pip install -e .

# Or for just dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt  # (new pip format)
```

## Testing the Package

Run the existing test suite:
```bash
python main.py
```

Or run individual tests:
```bash
python test.py
```

## Next Steps (Optional)

Consider these enhancements:
1. Add unit tests with pytest
2. Set up continuous integration (CI)
3. Add type hints for better IDE support
4. Create documentation with Sphinx
5. Publish to PyPI for wider distribution
6. Add GitHub Actions for automated testing

## Compatibility

- Python 3.7+
- Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- All major package managers (pip, conda)
